BaboscOS: <i>Bare And Basic Open Source Console-based Operating System</i> (insane naming, i know)

## What's this?

This is just a tinkering project (so expect thing to be messy)<br />
It's basically a tiny useless 64-bit operating system that only works on x86 arch.
I have some cool ideas for this project, but I'm taking things one at a time, so we'll see where this goes.

## What's the reason?

I wanted to build an os, and so now im finally attempting that. I decided to start off with this [limine template](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine-c-template) after reading the osdev wiki for a while. I figured it was a better place to start than to write my own bootloader lol (but i do plan on doing that one day).
