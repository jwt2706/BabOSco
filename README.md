BaboscOS: <i>Bare And Basic Open Source Console-based Operating System</i> (insane naming, i know)

Super simple 64bit operating system featuring a limine protocol compliant (higher half) kernel. It's just built for x86 right now

I wanted to build an os one day, and so now im finally attempting that. I decided to start off with this [limine template](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine-c-template) after reading the osdev wiki for so dang long. I figured it was a better place to start than to write my own bootloader lol (but i do plan on doing that one day).

I got some cool ideas for this project, but we're taking things one at a time. idk if im going to write seperate docs on this or just really take the time to just write out my thought process in comments but yeah
